# I. Introduction

### Motivation 

Motivation for this project stems from the desire to implement reproducibility practices into students' working habits. This project is the first attempt to create a reproducible project using bash, markdown, pandoc, Git, Github, Make and Sublime Text. Another motivating factor behind this project is to recap what we have learned about those computational tools mentioned above.
