Motivation for this project stems from the desire to implement reproducibility practices into a student's project-working habits. This project is the first attempt to create a reproducible project using bash, markdown, pandoc, Git, Github, Make and Sublime Text.

### *iii/ Scope* 

The project will discuss general definitions and roles of each computational tool in the project. Personal reflection and thoughts will also be expressed. 

### *iv/ Purpose*

 The purpose behind this project is to recap on what we have learned about those computational tools mentioned above. With hands-on practice and reflections on what we have learned so far, this project can be used as a tutorial for future references.
