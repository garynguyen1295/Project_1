##i. Makefile

From a website:

* A makefile is used with the UNIX make utility to determine which portions of a program to compile. A makefile is basically a script that guides the make utility to choose the appropriate program files that are to be compiled and linked together.

In my own words, a Makefile is a text file in which certain command lines are implemented. Such command lines are in the format 

	target: dependencies 
		command line       

Makefile allows compiling programs within the workflow of a project faster and more efficiently. Instead of writing multiple commands and running each of them to compile files we want, we can run the Makefile to compile multiple files at once. 

In this particular project, Makefile allows us to concatinate  different segments of our essay into a single .rmd file and from there, outputs an html file so that we can see our essay with images included in there. So when we modify a .md file, we can run the Makefile from our terminal to see the .html file.


##*ii/ Git*

### Description 

Git is a version control system that allows us to make our changes from terminal visible and trackable on our Github repository. Git includes many commands (git init, git add, git commit, git push etc. ) that allow us to track, add, and commit changes. These changes will be then reflected in our project workflow.   



### Role: 

In this project, Git allows us to commit changes we make from our local directories in our computers and publish those changes on our online Github repository. In a way, Git is a tool that connects us to our Github repository

###Description

Github is a repository site where we store and update the content of our working project. Github is typically useful in group projects, especially when we work on the same workflow. Git allows us to add , commit and track changes and thus communicate with each other more effectively. Github is like the interface where we can see the end-results of those changes. 

###Role

We would work on our project using command lines and built-in software from our computers, and then commit those changes using Git tool. Then we'll be able to see changes we made on our Github repository. Our collaborators can also see these changes as well. 

##*iv/ Pandoc*

### Description 
Pandoc is a document converter that allows us to convert a document from one type to the other (from md file to html file, from md file to pdf file, etc.).

### Usefulness in Project 1 
Pandoc is used to convert our concatinated 'paper.md' file into 'paper.html' file. Since we incorporated images into our md files, html file format is needed for showing the graphical effects we used in our paper.
And so as we write up our paper in our .md files using markdown format, pandoc allows us to generate an html file that showcases all the characteristics we intended in our markdown file. 

##*v/ Markdown*

###Description

Markdown is a markup language that can be converted into other file formats, such HTML and PDF. Markdown provides a user-friendly interface for users since its syntax is not so complicated. Using Markdown, we will be able to create Written Documents that can include Mathematical formulas, code chunks and pictures, etc..
