#Conclusion 

Throughout this project, I mostly refered to the tutorial on "Git- Version Control" that we did during lab. Different Git commands contained in the tutorial became very useful in this project. As for creating my Makefile, Sinhudja's help was crucial. But time didn't allow me to ask for more help on the Makefile, and as a result my Makefile was not completed. I decided to compared mine with some of my friends' Makefiles, and thanks to that, I was able to finalize my Makefile. That was the most challenging part of the project.
