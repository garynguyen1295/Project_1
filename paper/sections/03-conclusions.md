#III. Conclusion 

List of resources used:

* Git tutorial from lab 02
* Command lines from Homework 1
  

Throughout this project, I mostly refered to the tutorial on **"Git- Version Control"** that we did during lab. Different Git commands contained in the tutorial became very useful in this project. 

In order to see the big picture of the project, I relied on professor Sanchez's instructions. They were crucial to my undertanding of the project as a whole. He broke down different parts of the project and talked about the overall file structure I needed to create for this project.

As for creating my Makefile, Sinhudja's help was crucial. But time didn't allow me to ask for more help on the Makefile, and as a result my Makefile was not completed. I decided to compared mine with some of my friends' Makefiles, and thanks to that, I was able to finalize my Makefile. That was the most challenging part of the project. 

Creating the file structure in local directories is the easier part in this project. I was able to create it from Professor Sanchez's instructions and sometimes refered to **Homework 1** for usage of command lines used in this project.   

The most time consuming part was writing out the report. Without considering the amount of time it took to type, I experienced some difficulties with inserting images into the report. With a little google search, a website (url needed) helped me figure this out. And demonstration during the lecture provided me with the conceptual understanding of relative paths.
