#III. Conclusion 

List of resources used:

* Git tutorial from lab 02
* Command lines from Homework 1
  

Throughout this project, I mostly refered to the tutorial on **"Git- Version Control"** that we did during lab. Different Git commands contained in the tutorial became very useful in this project. 

In order to see understand the big picture of the project, professor Sanchez's instructions were crucial to my undertanding. He broke down different parts of the project and talked about the overall file structure I needed to create for this project.

As for creating my Makefile, Sinhudja's help was crucial. But time didn't allow me to ask for more help on the Makefile, and as a result my Makefile was not completed. I decided to compared mine with some of my friends' Makefiles, and thanks to that, I was able to finalize my Makefile. That was the most challenging part of the project. 

Creating the file structure in local directories is the easier part in this project. I was able to create it from Professor Sanchez's instructions and sometimes refered to **Homework 1** for usage of command lines used in this project.   

The most time consuming part was writing out the report. Without considering the amount of time it took to type, I experienced some difficulties with inserting images into the report. With a little google search, a website (url needed) helped me figure this out. And demonstration during lecture provided me with the conceptual understanding of relative paths.
